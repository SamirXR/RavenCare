- Hepatology

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "specialty": "Cardiology",
  "potential_conditions": [
    "Acute Coronary Syndrome",
    "Unstable Angina",
    "Myocardial Infarction"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Patient presents with classic cardiac symptoms including chest pain radiating to left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. These symptoms are highly suggestive of acute cardiac event requiring immediate evaluation.",
  "red_flags": [
    "Chest pain radiating to arm",
    "Diaphoresis (sweating)",
    "Shortness of breath at rest"
  ],
  "recommended_tests": [
    "ECG (12-lead)",
    "Cardiac Troponin I/T",
    "Complete Blood Count",
    "Lipid Profile"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: AI Analysis Stage 2 - Grok Urgency Scoring

**AI Model**: xAI Grok 4 Fast Reasoning

**Primary Objectives**:
1. **Urgency Quantification**: Calculate numerical urgency score (0-100)
2. **Risk Stratification**: Categorize patient into risk levels
3. **Time Sensitivity**: Determine required time-to-treatment
4. **Critical Flag Identification**: Highlight life-threatening symptoms

**Urgency Score Scale**:

| Score Range | Urgency Level | Action Required | Timeline |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| 0-25 | **Low** | Routine care | Days to weeks |
| 26-50 | **Moderate** | Same-day appointment | Within 24 hours |
| 51-75 | **High** | Urgent care | Within 2-6 hours |
| 76-100 | **Critical** | Emergency care | Immediate |

**Risk Level Categories**:
- **Low Risk**: Stable condition, no immediate danger
- **Moderate Risk**: Requires prompt attention but not life-threatening
- **High Risk**: Potentially serious, needs urgent evaluation
- **Critical Risk**: Life-threatening situation, emergency response needed

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "urgency_score": 92,
  "risk_level": "critical",
  "time_to_treatment": "immediate - emergency department",
  "red_flags": [
    "Possible myocardial infarction in progress",
    "High risk for cardiac arrest",
    "Time-sensitive cardiac event"
  ],
  "reasoning": "The combination of crushing chest pain, radiation to left arm, diaphoresis, and dyspnea represents a constellation of symptoms highly indicative of acute MI. Immediate emergency department evaluation with ECG and cardiac biomarkers is essential. Delay in treatment could result in significant myocardial damage or death."
}
```

## 8-Factor Scoring Algorithm

The **8-Factor Scoring Algorithm** is the crown jewel of RavenCare's intelligent matching system. It represents a significant evolution from basic matching to a sophisticated, multi-dimensional evaluation system that considers medical expertise, patient preferences, urgency factors, and age-appropriate care.

### Algorithm Overview

**Maximum Possible Score**: **170 points**

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Medical Appropriateness First**: Prioritizes clinical suitability over convenience
- **Urgency-Aware**: Critical cases automatically matched with senior, experienced doctors
- **Sub-Specialization Intelligence**: Matches specific conditions with relevant expertise
- **Age-Appropriate Care**: Considers pediatric and geriatric needs
- **Patient-Centered**: Incorporates patient preferences (language, timing)
- **Quality-Focused**: Rewards excellence (ratings, awards, experience)

**Evolution from Basic to Advanced**:

| Version | Factors | Max Score | Key Features |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Version 1.0** (Basic) | 3 factors | 100 points | Slot + Language + Rating only |
| **Version 2.0** (Current) | 8 factors | 170 points | Sub-specialty, urgency, age matching, comprehensive scoring |

---

### The 8 Factors Explained

#### Factor 1: Slot Availability (40-60 points)

**Base Value**: 40 points  
**Maximum Value**: 60 points  
**Weight**: Highest (35% of total score)

**Why It's Important**: Timely access to care is crucial, especially for urgent cases. This factor ensures patients get appointments when they need them most.

**Scoring Logic**:

1. **Exact Match (40 points)**
   - Doctor's available slot matches patient's preferred time slot exactly
   - Example: Patient prefers 10:00 AM, Doctor has 10:00 AM available
   
2. **Critical Urgency Bonus (+20 points)**
   - Applied when urgency score ≥ 90 (Critical category)
   - Total: 60 points for critical cases with exact match
   - Rationale: Critical patients need immediate access, so perfect timing match is rewarded heavily
   
3. **Alternative Slot Available (20 points)**
   - Doctor has slots available, but not the exact preferred time
   - Still provides access to care, just not at ideal time
   - Example: Patient prefers 10:00 AM, Doctor has 11:00 AM or 2:00 PM available
   
4. **No Availability (0 points)**
   - Doctor has no available appointment slots
   - Should not be matched unless no other options exist

**Real-World Example**:
```
Patient: Prefers 9:00 AM, Urgency Score = 95 (Critical - possible heart attack)
Doctor A: Has 9:00 AM available → 40 + 20 = 60 points (critical bonus applied)
Doctor B: Has 10:00 AM available → 20 points (alternative slot)
Doctor C: No slots available → 0 points
```

---

#### Factor 2: Language Match (25 points)

**Maximum Value**: 25 points  
**Weight**: 15% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Clear communication between doctor and patient is fundamental for accurate diagnosis, treatment compliance, and patient satisfaction. Language barriers can lead to misdiagnosis and poor outcomes.

**Scoring Logic**:

1. **Perfect Match (25 points)**
   - Patient's preferred language is in doctor's list of spoken languages
   - Example: Patient speaks Hindi, Doctor speaks Hindi, English, Tamil
   
2. **No Match (0 points)**
   - Patient's preferred language not spoken by doctor
   - Communication would require translator (not ideal)

**Real-World Example**:
```
Patient: Prefers Tamil
Doctor A: Speaks Tamil, English, Hindi → 25 points
Doctor B: Speaks English, Hindi only → 0 points
```

**Impact**: In multilingual countries like India, this factor is critical. A patient explaining chest pain symptoms in their native language provides much richer clinical information than struggling in a second language.

---

#### Factor 3: Doctor Rating (20 points)

**Maximum Value**: 20 points  
**Weight**: 12% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Patient satisfaction ratings reflect clinical quality, bedside manner, communication skills, and overall care experience. High-rated doctors tend to provide better outcomes.

**Scoring Logic**:

- **Formula**: `(doctor_rating / 5.0) × 20`
- **Scale**: 0-5 stars → 0-20 points
- **Linear scaling** ensures proportional reward

**Scoring Examples**:

| Doctor Rating | Calculation | Points Awarded |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| 5.0 stars | (5.0 / 5.0) × 20 | 20 points |
| 4.5 stars | (4.5 / 5.0) × 20 | 18 points |
| 4.0 stars | (4.0 / 5.0) × 20 | 16 points |
| 3.5 stars | (3.5 / 5.0) × 20 | 14 points |
| 3.0 stars | (3.0 / 5.0) × 20 | 12 points |
| 2.0 stars | (2.0 / 5.0) × 20 | 8 points |

**Real-World Example**:
```
Doctor A: 4.9/5.0 rating (98% satisfaction) → 19.6 points
Doctor B: 4.2/5.0 rating (84% satisfaction) → 16.8 points
Doctor C: 3.5/5.0 rating (70% satisfaction) → 14.0 points
```

---

#### Factor 4: Experience Years (15 points)

**Maximum Value**: 15 points  
**Weight**: 9% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Clinical experience correlates with diagnostic accuracy, surgical skill, and ability to handle complex cases. More experienced doctors have seen more clinical scenarios and can recognize subtle patterns.

**Scoring Logic**:

- **Formula**: `min(experience_years, 30) / 30 × 15`
- **Cap**: 30 years (to avoid over-weighting very senior doctors who may be less active)
- **Gradual scaling** rewards experience proportionally

**Scoring Examples**:

| Experience | Calculation | Points Awarded |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 30+ years | (30 / 30) × 15 | 15 points (max) |
| 25 years | (25 / 30) × 15 | 12.5 points |
| 20 years | (20 / 30) × 15 | 10 points |
| 15 years | (15 / 30) × 15 | 7.5 points |
| 10 years | (10 / 30) × 15 | 5 points |
| 5 years | (5 / 30) × 15 | 2.5 points |
| 2 years | (2 / 30) × 15 | 1 point |

**Real-World Example**:
```
Doctor A: 28 years experience → 14 points
Doctor B: 15 years experience → 7.5 points
Doctor C: 5 years experience → 2.5 points
```

**Why Capped at 30 Years?**: Doctors with 35-40 years of experience may be nearing retirement or reducing their clinical hours. The cap ensures we don't over-prioritize seniority at the expense of active practice.

---

#### Factor 5: Sub-Specialization Match (30 points) ⭐ **MOST INNOVATIVE**

**Maximum Value**: 30 points  
**Weight**: 18% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Within each specialty, doctors have sub-specializations. A cardiologist might focus on interventional procedures, while another focuses on heart failure management. Matching the patient's specific condition to the right sub-specialist dramatically improves outcomes.

**Scoring Logic**:

1. **Strong Match (30 points)**
   - Patient's symptoms/condition directly matches doctor's sub-specialization
   - Algorithm detects relevant medical keywords in symptoms
   - Example: "Arrhythmia" symptoms matched with "Electrophysiology" sub-specialist
   
2. **Partial Match (15 points)**
   - Some overlap between condition and sub-specialization
   - Related but not exact match
   - Example: General cardiac symptoms with preventive cardiology specialist
   
3. **No Match (0 points)**
   - No relevant sub-specialization alignment
   - Doctor is general specialist without specific focus

**How It Works**:

The system maintains a **comprehensive medical keyword database** with **200+ keywords** mapped to sub-specializations across all 11 specialties. When a patient describes symptoms, the algorithm:

1. Extracts medical keywords from symptom description
2. Compares against sub-specialization keyword database
3. Finds the best matching sub-specialization
4. Scores doctors based on sub-specialization alignment

**Example - Cardiology Sub-Specializations**:

| Sub-Specialty | Example Keywords | Use Cases |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Interventional Cardiology** | blocked arteries, angioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, MI, chest pain on exertion | Heart attacks, blocked arteries, need for stents |
| **Electrophysiology** | arrhythmia, irregular heartbeat, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, AFib, tachycardia | Heart rhythm disorders, pacemaker needs |
| **Heart Failure** | shortness of breath, swelling, edema, fluid retention, cardiomyopathy, fatigue | Chronic heart failure management |
| **Preventive Cardiology** | high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, risk assessment, family history | Risk reduction, prevention programs |

**Real-World Example**:
```
Patient Symptoms: "Irregular heartbeat, episodes of rapid heart rate, feeling dizzy"
Keyword Detection: "irregular heartbeat" + "rapid heart rate" → Electrophysiology

Doctor A: Sub-specialization = "Electrophysiology, Arrhythmia Management" → 30 points (strong match)
Doctor B: Sub-specialization = "Interventional Cardiology" → 0 points (no match)
Doctor C: Sub-specialization = "General Cardiology" → 0 points (no specific match)
```

**Impact**: This factor alone can make the difference between seeing a general cardiologist vs. an arrhythmia specialist - potentially saving critical diagnostic time and improving treatment outcomes.

---

#### Factor 6: Awards & Recognition (10 points)

**Maximum Value**: 10 points  
**Weight**: 6% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Professional awards indicate excellence recognized by peers, medical institutions, or professional bodies. Awards reflect superior clinical outcomes, research contributions, or teaching excellence.

**Scoring Logic**:

1. **Has Awards (10 points)**
   - Doctor has received professional recognition
   - Examples: "Best Cardiologist 2023", "Excellence in Patient Care", "Outstanding Physician Award"
   
2. **No Awards (0 points)**
   - No recorded awards or recognition

**Real-World Example**:
```
Doctor A: "Excellence in Cardiac Surgery 2022, Best Cardiologist Award 2023" → 10 points
Doctor B: No awards listed → 0 points
```

**Why 10 Points?**: Awards are important but shouldn't outweigh clinical factors like sub-specialization match or urgency-experience alignment. This weight ensures excellence is rewarded without dominating the scoring.

---

#### Factor 7: Age-Appropriate Care (10 points) ⭐ **PATIENT-CENTERED**

**Maximum Value**: 10 points  
**Weight**: 6% of total score

**Why It's Important**: Children and elderly patients have unique medical needs. Pediatric specialists understand child development and age-specific conditions. Experienced doctors are better equipped for complex geriatric care with multiple comorbidities.

**Scoring Logic**:

**For Pediatric Patients (Age 0-18)**:
- **Pediatric Specialist (10 points)**
  - Doctor's sub-specialization includes "pediatric" keywords
  - Example: "Pediatric Cardiology", "Children's Heart Specialist"
  
**For Geriatric Patients (Age 65+)**:
- **Experienced Doctor (5 points)**
  - Doctor has 10+ years experience
  - Rationale: Elderly patients often have complex medical histories and multiple conditions; experienced doctors handle this complexity better

**For Adult Patients (Age 19-64)**:
- **No specific bonus (0 points)**
  - Standard matching applies

**Real-World Examples**:

**Scenario 1: 8-year-old with heart murmur**
```
Doctor A: "Pediatric Cardiologist, 15 years experience" → 10 points
Doctor B: "General Cardiologist, 20 years experience" → 0 points
(Even though Doctor B has more experience, pediatric specialty matters more for children)
```

**Scenario 2: 72-year-old with heart failure**
```
Doctor A: "Heart Failure Specialist, 22 years experience" → 5 points
Doctor B: "Heart Failure Specialist, 6 years experience" → 0 points
(Elderly patient benefits from senior doctor's experience managing complex cases)
```

---

#### Factor 8: Urgency-Experience Alignment (10 points) ⭐ **LIFE-SAVING**

**Maximum Value**: 10 points  
**Weight**: 6% of total score

**Why It's Important**: In critical medical situations, you want the most experienced doctor available. This factor ensures that patients with life-threatening conditions are matched with senior specialists who have the skills and experience to handle emergencies.

**Scoring Logic**:

**For Critical Urgency (Score ≥ 90)**:
- **Senior Specialist Required: 20+ years experience → 10 points**
- **Rationale**: Critical cases (possible heart attack, stroke, severe trauma) need doctors who have seen hundreds of similar cases

**For High Urgency (Score 70-89)**:
- **Experienced Specialist Required: 10+ years experience → 10 points**
- **Rationale**: High urgency cases need solid experience and quick decision-making

**For Moderate/Low Urgency (Score < 70)**:
- **No specific requirement → 0 points**
- **Rationale**: Routine cases can be handled by doctors at any experience level

**Real-World Examples**:

**Scenario 1: Critical Case - Possible Heart Attack (Urgency = 95)**
```
Patient: 58-year-old with crushing chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath

Doctor A: 25 years experience → 10 points (critical urgency bonus)
Doctor B: 8 years experience → 0 points (insufficient for critical case)

Result: Doctor A is strongly preferred for this life-threatening situation
```

**Scenario 2: High Urgency - Severe Arrhythmia (Urgency = 75)**
```
Patient: 65-year-old with rapid irregular heartbeat, dizziness

Doctor A: 15 years experience → 10 points (high urgency bonus)
Doctor B: 5 years experience → 0 points (needs more experience)

Result: Doctor A is preferred for managing complex arrhythmia
```

**Scenario 3: Routine Case - Follow-up (Urgency = 30)**
```
Patient: 40-year-old routine cardiology check-up

Doctor A: 20 years experience → 0 points (no urgency bonus)
Doctor B: 3 years experience → 0 points (no urgency bonus)

Result: Both equally acceptable; other factors determine match
```

**Impact**: This factor is potentially life-saving. It ensures that a patient having a heart attack isn't matched with a newly qualified cardiologist when a senior interventional cardiologist is available.

## Sub-Specialization Intelligence

One of the most sophisticated components of RavenCare is its **Sub-Specialization Intelligence System**. This system recognizes that within each medical specialty, there are highly specialized areas of focus. Matching a patient's specific condition to a doctor's sub-specialization can dramatically improve clinical outcomes.

### The Challenge

Consider **Cardiology** - it's a broad specialty covering everything from:
- Heart attacks and blocked arteries → **Interventional Cardiology**
- Irregular heartbeats and pacemakers → **Electrophysiology**
- Chronic heart failure management → **Heart Failure Specialist**
- Risk assessment and prevention → **Preventive Cardiology**

A patient with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) would be much better served by an electrophysiologist than an interventional cardiologist, even though both are excellent cardiologists.

### The Solution: Medical Keyword Database

RavenCare maintains a comprehensive database of **200+ medical keywords** mapped to sub-specializations across all 11 specialties. This allows the system to:

1. **Extract Keywords**: Analyze patient symptom descriptions
2. **Match Patterns**: Identify relevant sub-specialization keywords
3. **Score Alignment**: Calculate match strength between symptoms and doctor expertise
4. **Assign Points**: Award up to 30 points for strong sub-specialization matches

### How Sub-Specialization Matching Works

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Symptom Analysis**
   - Patient describes: "I have been having episodes of rapid irregular heartbeat, sometimes feeling dizzy and short of breath"
   
2. **Keyword Extraction**
   - System identifies: "rapid irregular heartbeat", "dizzy"
   
3. **Database Lookup**
   - Searches Cardiology sub-specialization keywords
   - Finds matches in "Electrophysiology" category
   
4. **Match Scoring**
   - Counts keyword matches: 2 strong matches
   - Determines match strength: **Strong Match**
   
5. **Point Assignment**
   - Awards 30 points for strong sub-specialization match
   
6. **Doctor Filtering**
   - Prioritizes doctors with "Electrophysiology" or "Arrhythmia" in their sub-specialization field

### Real-World Impact Examples

#### Example 1: Cardiac Case

**Patient**: 62-year-old with "crushing chest pain radiating to left arm, sweating"

**Without Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- General cardiologist matched → May focus on routine care
- Delay in recognizing acute MI → Delayed intervention

**With Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- Keywords: "chest pain" + "radiating to arm" → **Interventional Cardiology**
- Interventional cardiologist matched → Expert in emergency cardiac procedures
- Immediate recognition of acute MI → Rapid catheterization if needed
- **Result**: Faster treatment, better outcomes

---

#### Example 2: Neurological Case

**Patient**: 45-year-old with "recurrent episodes of jerking movements, loss of awareness"

**Without Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- General neurologist matched → Broad expertise
- Standard workup initiated

**With Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- Keywords: "jerking movements" + "loss of awareness" → **Epilepsy**
- Epilepsy specialist matched → Expert in seizure disorders
- Immediate recognition of complex partial seizures
- Specialized EEG interpretation and medication management
- **Result**: Accurate diagnosis, optimal medication selection

---

#### Example 3: Gastrointestinal Case

**Patient**: 28-year-old with "chronic bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weight loss"

**Without Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- General gastroenterologist matched → Broad GI expertise

**With Sub-Specialization Matching**:
- Keywords: "chronic" + "bloody diarrhea" + "weight loss" → **Inflammatory Bowel Disease**
- IBD specialist matched → Expert in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis
- Recognition of likely IBD → Immediate colonoscopy and biopsy planning
- **Result**: Rapid diagnosis, appropriate immunosuppressive therapy

---

### Benefits of Sub-Specialization Intelligence

✅ **Precision Matching**: Patients see doctors with exact relevant expertise  
✅ **Faster Diagnosis**: Specialists recognize condition patterns immediately  
✅ **Better Outcomes**: Sub-specialists have higher success rates in their focus area  
✅ **Reduced Referrals**: Less need for secondary referrals to other specialists  
✅ **Patient Satisfaction**: Confidence in seeing "the right doctor" for their problem  
✅ **System Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization across medical staff

---

### Algorithm Intelligence

The sub-specialization matching algorithm is **context-aware**:

- **Multiple Keywords**: Weighs multiple matching keywords for stronger matches
- **Keyword Variations**: Recognizes medical synonyms (MI = heart attack = myocardial infarction)
- **Combination Patterns**: Detects symptom combinations that suggest specific conditions
- **Priority Scoring**: Some keywords carry more weight (e.g., "stroke" is high priority)
- **Fallback Logic**: If no strong match found, defaults to general specialist in that specialty

This intelligence ensures that the system doesn't just match keywords mechanically, but understands the clinical context and makes medically sound decisions.

### Key Takeaways from Examples

1. **Critical Cases Get Best Matches**: The algorithm ensures life-threatening cases (Urgency 90+) are matched with senior, specialized doctors (Examples 1 & 3)

2. **Sub-Specialization is Crucial**: 30 points can make or break a match - seeing a Stroke specialist vs. general neurologist can save lives

3. **Age Matters**: Pediatric patients MUST see pediatric specialists (Example 2 gets 10 bonus points)

4. **Language Helps**: 25 points for language match improves communication and patient satisfaction

5. **Experience Counts for Emergencies**: Critical cases require 20+ years experience for the urgency-experience bonus

6. **Fair Matches Are Acceptable**: For routine low-urgency cases (Example 4), a fair match is sufficient since clinical risk is low
